## Local development  
Install dependencies `npm i`  
Start application `npm run start` (should serve at http://localhost:4200/**)  
<br>
## How to deploy
Execute command `ng build --prod`  
Push output files and folder into that repo `https://gitlab.com/bauerjakob-prod/website`  
From there nothing more to do. It automatically deploys it via webhook. ðŸ˜„
